# Computer Vision Tools for programmers

For application developers, especially mobile app developers, finding the correct vision library is not an easy task.
A usual to-go is [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) library, a comprehensive and robust computer vision library that can run on most platforms, including Linux, Windows, Mac OS, Android, and iOS. OpenCV is a SwissTool for computer vision. 
It includes an army of widely-used computer vision algorithms for simple tasks such as color conversion to complicated processing such as face recognition.
However, as a SwissTool, OpenCV can be slow for a lot of computer vision tasks. 
Particularly, for mobile devices, OpenCV has too much footprint to satisfy the real-time latency requirements.
Besides, it may also contain the particular algorithm you want. 

Here I put together a list of OpenCV alternatives that can facilitate building you computer vision applications.

| Library | CPU | GPU Support | Mobile Oriented| Comments | 
|---------|-----|-----|
| OpenCV | yes | no | cuda api, limited functions|
| dlib | yes | no | no |
| openVX | yes | no | yes |
| openGL | no | yes |
| GPUImage | no | yes |
| Accelerated CV | 
| Armadillo |
