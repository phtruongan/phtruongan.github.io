# Biography

Currently, I am a Ph.D. student at Aalto University. My PhD dissertation targets to address problems in data labeling for computer vision (CV). In particular, in my dissertation, several algorithms and prototype tools are developed to automate or reduce the manual effort for the data labeling tasks by extracting the knowledge from demonstrating videos in assembly videos. Plus, I developed a tool for generating AR applications based on the input of extracted workflow from the assembly videos.
During doing research, I participated and developed several CV algorithms in several projects such as RECAP, CEAMA, and Facades. My research of interest is Computer Vision and Human Computer Interaction. 

My PhD advisor is [Prof. Yu Xiao](https://people.aalto.fi/yu.xiao).
